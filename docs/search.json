Previous studies have demonstrated that psychophysiological abnormalities such as low resting heart rate were significant correlates of psychopathic traits in children and adolescents.\nGrowing evidence suggests social factors also influence the development of psychopathic traits i. Peer victimization ii. Poor household circumstances iii. High levels of stress within the family iv. Negative parenting practices: 1. Corporal punishment 2. Inconsistent discipline 3.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the current study, the moderating effects of resting heart rate (a measure of biological sensitivity) and sex on the relationships between neighborhood collective efficacy, psychopathic traits and antisocial behaviors were examined in a sample of 245 8–11 year-old boys and girls.\nSome children are biologically more susceptible to environmental influences, and Biological sensitivity may be expressed differently in boys and girls.\nIn the current study, the authors investigated the effect of neighborhood characteristics on the three dimensions of child psychopathy and the potential moderating effect of HR. And if there is a moderating effect by sex.\nHierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that:\n\nBoth grandiose-manipulative and callous-unemotional traits were associated with neighborhood social processes, but the relationship varied by child’s sex and heart rate level.\nDaring-impulsive traits were not associated with either social processes or heart rate.\nIn addition, aggression and delinquency were associated with social control, and the relationship was moderated by heart rate and sex.\nFindings suggest that neighborhood social processes are distinctly associated with the three dimensions of childhood psychopathy and with conduct problems in children with a specific psychophysiological profile, and that these relationships are further differentiated by sex.\n\nPer the paper: Accordingly, Diamond et al. (2012) suggested that there may be a “trade-off” between autonomic flexibility and self-regulation, which may be weighted differently in boys and girls, potentially giving rise to differences in observed autonomic reactivity.\nThis may also partially explain the surprising finding that for boys with lower HR and girls with higher HR, higher social control was actually a risk factor for aggressive behavior, a finding that is contradictory to the well-established negative association between HR and antisocial behavior (Sampson et al., 2002).\nIt is possible that while higher HR in boys and lower HR in girls are adaptive physiological states for responding to favorable social processes, the opposite resting states may index maladaptive physiological states."

P. 2015) Abnormally low resting RSA or large reductions in RSA specifically during emotion evocation are associated with symptoms of both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology\nsupported by medial prefrontal cortex to the PNS(inhibitory efferent pathways), RSA measured during executive function task\nEmotions are generated by phylogenetically old, subcortical neural circuits but regulatted by phylogenetically new cortical neural circuits\nIt is far more likely that the PNS via the vagus nerve, mediates links between the PFC and cardiovascular function\nPolyvagal Theory leads toward a hierarchical conceptualization of feelings as higher brain interpretations of the neural signals conveying information regarding visceral organs (e.g., heart, gut, etc.) to the brainstem (Porges , 2022)\nThis psychophysiological perspective emphasizes the foundational function of autonomic state in the subjective experiences of global feelings and specific emotions. Within this hierarchical conceptualization, feelings of safety are preeminent and form the core of an enduring motivational system that shifts autonomic state, which in turn drives behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.\nThe main point of the model is that higher behavioral functions, which are frequently intentional, are dependent on the functioning of the more survival focused foundational systems embedded in the brainstem."

    "text": "RSA as a physiological index of PNS cardiac control, as a measure of emotion dysregulation (Beauchaine, T. P. 2015) Abnormally low resting RSA or large reductions in RSA specifically during emotion evocation are associated with symptoms of both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology\nsupported by medial prefrontal cortex to the PNS(inhibitory efferent pathways), RSA measured during executive function task\nEmotions are generated by phylogenetically old, subcortical neural circuits but regulatted by phylogenetically new cortical neural circuits\nIt is far more likely that the PNS via the vagus nerve, mediates links between the PFC and cardiovascular function\nPolyvagal Theory leads toward a hierarchical conceptualization of feelings as higher brain interpretations of the neural signals conveying information regarding visceral organs (e.g., heart, gut, etc.) to the brainstem (Porges , 2022)\nThis psychophysiological perspective emphasizes the foundational function of autonomic state in the subjective experiences of global feelings and specific emotions. Within this hierarchical conceptualization, feelings of safety are preeminent and form the core of an enduring motivational system that shifts autonomic state, which in turn drives behaviors, emotions, and thoughts.\nThe main point of the model is that higher behavioral functions, which are frequently intentional, are dependent on the functioning of the more survival focused foundational systems embedded in the brainstem."
