There were no significant main effects of social cohesion or resting HR, however the interaction between social cohesion and resting HR was significant.\nHigher social cohesion was associated with higher GM scores, but only in boys with higher HR\nLower social control was associated with higher CU traits in girls with lower HR.\nLower social control were associated with higher delinquency in girls with lower HR"

There were significant interaction effects of neighborhood social processes and resting HR on psychopathic traits and antisocial behavior, however the effects were different in boys and girls and across the various outcomes.\nHigher social cohesion was associated with higher GM traits, but only in boys with higher HR. Higher social control was associated with lower CU traits, but only in girls with lower resting HR.\nInterestingly, while we found that boys with higher HR and girls with lower HR had higher aggression when social control was lower, we also found that for boys with lower HR and girls with higher HR, the opposite pattern was observed, where higher aggression was associated with higher social control. Finally, we also found that lower social control was associated with higher delinquency in girls with lower HR.\nNeighborhood social processes are distinctly associated with the three dimensions of childhood psychopathy and with conduct problems in children with a specific psychophysiological profile.\nThese relationships are further differentiated by sex"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the current study, the moderating effects of resting heart rate (a measure of biological sensitivity) and sex on the relationships between neighborhood collective efficacy, psychopathic traits and antisocial behaviors were examined in a sample of 245 8–11 year-old boys and girls.\nSome children are biologically more susceptible to environmental influences, and Biological sensitivity may be expressed differently in boys and girls.\nIn the current study, the authors investigated the effect of neighborhood characteristics on the three dimensions of child psychopathy and the potential moderating effect of HR. And if there is a moderating effect by sex.\nHierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that:\n\nBoth grandiose-manipulative and callous-unemotional traits were associated with neighborhood social processes, but the relationship varied by child’s sex and heart rate level.\nDaring-impulsive traits were not associated with either social processes or heart rate.\nIn addition, aggression and delinquency were associated with social control, and the relationship was moderated by heart rate and sex.\nFindings suggest that neighborhood social processes are distinctly associated with the three dimensions of childhood psychopathy and with conduct problems in children with a specific psychophysiological profile, and that these relationships are further differentiated by sex.\n\nPer the paper: Accordingly, Diamond et al. (2012) suggested that there may be a “trade-off” between autonomic flexibility and self-regulation, which may be weighted differently in boys and girls, potentially giving rise to differences in observed autonomic reactivity.\nThis may also partially explain the surprising finding that for boys with lower HR and girls with higher HR, higher social control was actually a risk factor for aggressive behavior, a finding that is contradictory to the well-established negative association between HR and antisocial behavior (Sampson et al., 2002).\nIt is possible that while higher HR in boys and lower HR in girls are adaptive physiological states for responding to favorable social processes, the opposite resting states may index maladaptive physiological states."

An evolutionary–developmental theory of the origins and functions of stress reactivity(2005), along with phylogeny, and animal studies cites previous research on biological stress response and behavior outcomes.\nThe significance of reactivity to environment or stressors is detailed:\nOf particular relevance is the personality construct of reactivity (Strelau,1983), which indexes relatively stable individual differences in the intensity (or magnitude) of response to stimulation.\nHigher reactivity indicates less gating of internal information stemming from external events, and more reactive individuals are therefore susceptible to relatively weak environmental signals, have comparatively low optimal levels of arousal, and are less able than others to endure strong stimulation for prolonged periods of time\nBoyce and Ellis suggest there is a BSC phenotype due to differences in action of genetic and environmental influences that are hypothesized to constitute variations in susceptibility to environmental influence.\nCited by Boyce & Ellis: Bauer (2002) found, in a cross-sectional study, that the absolute levels of activation in either the sympathetic or adrenocortical system were less predictive of serious behavior problems in 4- to 8-year-old children than was the lack of concordance between the systems…children with activation asymmetries had the most, suggesting that dissociations between the sympathetic and adrenocortical arousal under conditions of challenge put children at risk for early psychopathology.\nRelevant to current paper, according to Biological sensitivity to context theory:\n\nChildren with higher physiological reactivity are more sensitive to their social environments whether it is supportive or adverse\nChildren with low physiological reactivity are not as affected by their environment\nHighly reactive children display poorer behavioral and health outcomes in harmful contexts such as adverse neighborhoods, or flourish under supportive environments.\nSome children are biologically more susceptible to environmental influences"
