## Psychophysiology

Psychophysiology transforms unobservable psychological or mental processes into measurable physiological data (Porges, 2006).

## Journal Article Presentation

**High Resting Heart Rate Protects Against the Intergenerational Transmission of Antisocial Behavior: A Birth Cohort Study**

Authors: **Raine, A., Choy, O., Achenbach, T. et al. (2023)**

Journal: **European Child & Adolescent Psychology**

## Background

In this paper the authors utilize heart rate as a measure of physiological function as a possible moderator between behavior and intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior. The following theoretical perspectives were included to support their logic:

-   Fearlessness Theory

    -   Low heart rate during a rest period reflects a relative lack of fear to a mild stressor for a child(unfamiliar laboratory)

    -   The authors write that higher resting heart rate reflects fearfulness and would decrease antisocial acts due to fear of punishment

-   Stimulation Seeking Theory

    -   Low physiological arousal motivates individuals to seek stimulation to increase their arousal levels (Risk-taking antisocial acts elevate arousal to optimal level)

    -   Regarding this theory, individuals with higher autonomic arousal may encourage individuals to avoid stimulating experiences.

## Question

-   Broad Question

    -   Examining resting heart rate as a biological protective factor, and the level of influence of psychosocial factors on antisocial behavior.

-   Specific Question

    -   Investigating biologcial correlates for intergenerational discontinuity of antisocial behavior

    -   Hypotheses:

    -   High heart rate may act as a protective factor in children. The high parent antisocial/low child antisocial group would have higher heart rates than the other three groups

## Logic

## Methods

-   The study location:

-   Island Mauritius

## Participants and Duration

Participants were recruited from a database of a birth cohort study of child health and development
The participants consisted of 405 parent-child dyads, N=810
Children born between 1969-1970 in two towns on the island were recruited.
Children were recruited at 3 years of age from September 1972 to August 1973
The towns Vacoas and Quatre, Bornes were chosen to represent the ethnic distribution of the island

The study took place from March 2018 to April 2019


## Demographics

Children (55.3% female) had a mean age of 15.3 years (range 11.0–19.9 years, SD = 2.2), with 78.5%
Indian and 21.5% Creole. 
Parents (75.8% female) had a mean age of 45.9 years (range 29.0–61.1 years, SD = 4.53), with 79.3% Indian and 20.7% Creole.

## Inventories utilized to assess antisocial behavior

Child self-reported antisocial behavior was assessed using
six scales. 
Aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior,
and attention problems were assessed using the Youth Self-
Report  
The fourth scale was the 10-item version of
the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits ICU  
The final two scales were the Reactive and Proactive Aggression scales of the
Reactive and Proactive Aggression Questionnaire

## Inventories Parents

Parents provided self-reports of aggressive behavior, rulebreaking
behavior, intrusive behavior, and attention problems
on the Adult Self-Report (ASR)

Parents also provided self-reports of reactive
and proactive aggression on the RPQ

## Social Adversity {.scrollable}

In a demographic interview with the parent, the following 16
indicators of social adversity were collected: parental teenage
pregnancy (2.0%), single parent family (14.8%), four or
more siblings (9.1%), father unemployed (3.2%), parent with
physical or mental health problems (2.7%), parent smoked
5 or more cigarettes per day (17.3%), parent drinks more
than 14 units of alcohol per week (5.2%), parent arrested
(5.9%), living in government housing (2.0%), low parental
education (19.5%), low occupation level (18.8%), low family
income (24.7%), poor home living conditions (19.8%),
problems with neighborhood crime (8.6%), problems with
neighborhood conditions (19.0%), and child illness (3.0%).

Variables were scored on the basis of being present (1) or absent (0), with
scores summed to provide a total adversity score.


## Analysis {.scrollable}

**Measure of intergenerational discontinuity**

-   Subtracting z-transformed parent antisocial measure from child antisocial measure

-   High scores indicated non-antisocial children whose parents were antisocial

-   Four permutations of parent-child antisocial groups were created

    -   Utilizing the median, parent and child analysis were divided above and below their respective medians to form four permutations

-   Trichotomization based on heart rate

    -   Per prior research middle half of distribution of heart rate scores were compared to the upper and lower quartiles to test for linear and non-linear effects on the dependent variable

## Results

## Resting Heart Rate and Intergenerational Continuity

There was a significant positive correlation between the
child’s resting heart rate and the intergenerational discontinuity
score, r = 0.16, d = 0.32, p < 0.001.

For the initial median split analyses (50% cut-point), there
was a significant effect of group on child resting heart rate,
F(3,392) = 2.98, p = 0.031, partial eta2 = 0.022.

The parent antisocial/child non-antisocial group had significantly higher
resting heart rates than every other group, who did not differ
significantly from one another

There was a main effect of heart rate
grouping on intergenerational discontinuity, F(2,393) = 5.03, p = 0.007, partial eta2
= 0.025.

## Discussion

Three kinds of evidence that high resting heart rate may protect against the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior. 

First, heart rate was positively associated with an intergenerational discontinuity score, with high heart rate associated with low child antisocial scores despite high parental antisocial scores. Second, a group of children with low levels of antisocial behavior but whose parents were
high in antisocial behavior had higher resting heart rates

Second, a group of children with low levels of antisocial behavior but whose parents were
high in antisocial behavior had higher resting heart rates than all three other groups of children. 

Third, a tertile split on resting heart rate indicated that high heart rate was a protective factor against the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior, rather than low heart rate representing a risk factor for intergenerational transmission. 

To our knowledge, these are the first findings to identify a biological variable as a protective factor against the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior in children.


## Limitations


Generalizability of sample to larger population, due to location accessibility.

Physiological measures differed in method of collection and location, as it did not take place in psychophysiology lab. 
Physical fitness, prior food intake, and medication use was not assessed.

## Inferences
 
This study focused on heart rate as a possible biological protective factor.
However investigation of associations of vagal tone with antisocial behavior measured as indices of Parasympathetic Nervous system have been conducted extensively. Studying physiological index of the PNS as a biological protective factor regarding transmission of antisocial behavior has yet to be studied, and would be a topic of future research.
