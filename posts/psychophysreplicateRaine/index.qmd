##  Psychophysiology

Psychophysiology transforms unobservable psychological or mental processes into measurable physiological data (Porges, 2006).

## Journal Article Presentation

**High Resting Heart Rate Protects Against the Intergenerational Transmission of Antisocial Behavior: A Birth Cohort Study**

Authors: **Raine, A., Choy, O., Achenbach, T. et al. (2023)**

Journal: **European Child & Adolescent Psychology**





## Background

In this paper the authors utilize heart rate as a measure of physiological function as a possible moderator between behavior and intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior.


Theoretical Perspectives.


Fearlessness Theory

Low heart rate during a rest period reflects a relative lack of fear to a mild stressor for a child(unfamiliar laboratory)

The authors write that higer resting heart rate reflects fearfulness and would decrease antisocial acts due to fear of punishment


Stimulation Seeking Theory

Low physiological arousal motivates individuals to seek stimulation to increase their arousal levels
(Risk-taking antisocial acts elevate arousal to optimal level)

Regarding this theory, individuals with higher autonomic arousal may encourage individuals to avoid stimulating experiences. 


## Key Terms

Emotional Regulation

This refers to the process of monitoring, evaluating and modulating emotional reactions with the purpose of goal attainment For example upregulating excitement, or dampening frustration to facilitate positive interpersonal interactions

RSA Withdrawal

Also referred to as vagal withdrawal. Vagal/RSA withdrawal as opposed to vagal/RSA augmentation. During vagal withdrawal the vagus nerve withdraws its control over the heart resulting in increased PNS(RSA) reactivity Appropriate levels of vagal withdrawal are adaptive and necessary for effectively reacting to external threats.

Vagus Augmentation

During vagus augmentation the Vagus nerve increases its control over the heart resulting in decreased PNS(RSA) reactivity. Vagal augmentation may lead to increased control of emotionality that can attenuate painful experiences and insensitivity to socializing punishments (Zhang, W., Fagan, S. E., Gao, Y. 2017)

## Logic

## Methods

## Analysis

**Measure of intergenerational discontinuity**

-   Subtracting z-transformed parent antisocial measure from child antisocial measure

-   High scores indicated non-antisocial children whose parents were antisocial

-   Four permutations of parent-child antisocial groups were created

    -   Utilizing the median, parent and child analysis were divided above and below their respective medians to form four permutations

-   Trichotomization based on heart rate

    -   Per prior research middle half of distribution of heart rate scores were compared to the upper and lower quartiles to test for linear and non-linear effects on the dependent variable
