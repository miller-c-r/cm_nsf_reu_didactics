## Question

Broad Question: The question of how meaningful associations between verbal and spatial information might be utilized to facilitate working memory performance

## Question

Specific Question: The present study explored how separable processing capacities within

specialized domains might each contribute to this, by examining the disruptive impacts of simple

verbal and spatial concurrent tasks on young adults' recall of visually presented digit sequences encountered either in a single location or within a meaningful spatial "keypad" configuration
