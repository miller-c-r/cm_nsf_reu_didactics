**Psychopathic Traits and Conduct Problems in Children: Effects of Collective Efficacy, Heart Rate, and Sex**

Kofler, L., Zhang, W., Gao, Y (2022)

## Abstract

In the current study, the moderating effects of resting heart rate (a measure of biological sensitivity) and sex on the relationships between neighborhood collective efficacy, psychopathic traits and antisocial behaviors were examined in a sample of 245 8--11 year-old boys and girls.

Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that:

1.  Both grandiose-manipulative and callous-unemotional traits were associated with neighborhood social processes, but the relationship varied by child's sex and heart rate level.

2.  Daring-impulsive traits were not associated with either social processes or heart rate.

3.  In addition, aggression and delinquency were associated with social control, and the relationship was moderated by heart rate and sex.

4.  Findings suggest that neighborhood social processes are distinctly associated with the three dimensions of childhood psychopathy and with conduct problems in children with a specific psychophysiological profile, and that these relationships are further differentiated by sex.

## Intro

Prior Research

Cited by the authors the, highly cited Biological sensitivity to context: I. An evolutionary--developmental theory of the origins and functions of stress reactivity(2005), along with phylogeny, and animal studies cites previous research on biological stress response and behavior outcomes.

The significance of reactivity to environment or stressors is detailed:

Of particular relevance is the personality construct of reactivity (Strelau,1983), which indexes relatively stable individual differences in the intensity (or magnitude) of response to stimulation.

Higher reactivity indicates less gating of internal information stemming from external events, and more reactive individuals are therefore susceptible to relatively weak environmental signals, have comparatively low optimal levels of arousal, and are less able than others to endure strong stimulation for prolonged periods of time

Boyce and Ellis suggest there is a BSC phenotype due to differences in action of genetic and environmental influences that are hypothesized to constitute variations in susceptibility to environmental influence.

Cited by Boyce & Ellis: Bauer (2002) found, in a cross-sectional study, that the absolute levels of activation in either the sympathetic or adrenocortical system were less predictive of serious behavior problems in 4- to 8-year-old children than was the lack of concordance between the systems...children with activation asymmetries had the most, suggesting that dissociations between the sympathetic and adrenocortical arousal under conditions of challenge put children at risk for early psychopathology.

Relevant to current paper, according to Biological sensitivity to context theory:

1.  Children with higher physiological reactivity are more sensitive to their social environments whether it is supportive or adverse

2.  Children with low physiological reactivity are not as affected by their environment

3.  Highly reactive children display poorer behavioral and health outcomes in harmful contexts such as adverse neighborhoods, or flourish under supportive environments.

4.  Some children are biologically more susceptible to environmental influences

## Specifc Question

Some children are biologically more susceptible to environmental influences, and Biological sensitivity may be expressed differently in boys and girls.

In the current study, the authors investigated the effect of neighborhood characteristics on the three dimensions of child psychopathy and the potential moderating effect of HR. And if there is a moderating effect by sex.

## Logic

Psychopathy begins at an early age and remains stable throughout the lifespan. What factors are associated with development of these traits. Previous studies have demonstrated that psychophysiological abnormalities such as low resting heart rate were significant correlates of psychopathic traits in children and adolescents.

Growing evidence suggests social factors also influence the development of psychopathic traits i. Peer victimization ii. Poor household circumstances iii. High levels of stress within the family iv. Negative parenting practices: 1. Corporal punishment 2. Inconsistent discipline 3. Poor supervision and monitoring v. Family and peer social factors previous research 4. Neighborhood characteristics research is scarce

## Logic for methods

Responses of biological system to stressors is indexed by different physiological measures: ANS, adrenocortical system resting HR acts as a moderator of various context-behavior relationships, resting heart rate is used as the physiological index of biological sensitivity in the study.

## Psychopathic Traits

Grandiose-Manipulative(GM), Callous-Unemotional(CU), Daring-Impulsive(DI)

## Methods {.scrollable}

-   Participants in longitudinal study. N = 245. 8-11 year old boys and girls and primary caregiver. Caregiver participants were mostly biological mothers.
-   Psychophysiological testing session included several tasks and lasted for approximately 40 minutes
-   HR obtained prior to and at the end of psychophysiological testing session. Resting heart rate was obtained by **averaging** the first 2-min rest period(before task) and the second 2 min period.
-   **Inventories**
    -   Measures of psychopathic traits Grandiose-Manipulative, Callous-Unemotional, Daring-Impulsive,
        -   APSD
            -   20-item scale designed for assessing child and adolescent psychopathic traits (Frick & Hare, 2001). The scale uses a three-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 2 (definitely true). In the current study, the GM (e.g.,"thinks he or she is more important than others") and DI (e.g., "acts without thinking") subscales were used.
        -   ICU
            -   The ICU consists of 24 items measured on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all true) to 3 (definitely true)
                -   The questionnaire is comprised of three subscales: Callousness (e.g., Does not seem to know "right" from "wrong"), Uncaring (e.g., Feeling bad or guilty when he/she has done something wrong), and Unemotional (e.g.,Expresses his/her feeling openly).
        -   Similar to the GM and DI scores, the children and their caregivers completed the self-report and parent-report versions of the questionnaire, and a combined CU score was created by taking the higher score reported for each item by either the child or the parent. If data were unavailable for one of the reporters, the avail
-   **Measures of aggression and delinquency**
-   Measures of antisocial behavior were obtained through caregiver completion of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). The CBCL is a widely used and reliable caregiver-report questionnaire that is used within both research and clinical settings and consists of 8 syndrome scales measuring **externalizing and internalizing behaviors** in youths (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001).
    -   The questionnaire consists of 112 items, where the caregiver rates the child's behavior now or within the past 6 months on statements such as 'argues a lot' and 'breaks rules at home, school, or elsewhere'
-   **Measures of collective efficacy**
    -   Measures of collective efficacy were collected through caregiver's reports using a neighborhood characteristics questionnaire replicated from Sampson et al.
    -   The questionnaire Sampson and colleagues developed captured these social processes in two subscales, which were utilized in the current study. The informal social control scale was comprised of 5 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "very unlikely" to "very likely", where respondents
        -   were asked to rate the likelihood that their neighbors could:
            -   be counted on to intervene if (i) children were skipping
            -   school and hanging out on a street corner, (ii) children were
            -   spray-painting graffiti on a local building, (iii) children were
            -   showing disrespect to an adult, (iv) a fight broke out in front
            -   of their house, and (v) the fire station closest to their home
            -   was threatened with budget cuts
-   **Psychophysiological Measures**
    -   The computer task
