## Music Lessons Enhance IQ

Music Lessons Enhance IQ

(2024) E. Glenn Schellenberg University of Toronto at Mississauga, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada

## Abstract

The idea that music makes you smarter has received considerable attention from scholars and the media. The present report is the first to test this hypothesis directly with random assignment of a large sample of children (N= 144) to two different types of music lessons (keyboard or voice) or to control groups that received drama lessons or no lessons.

## Abstract

IQ was measured before and after the lessons. Compared with children in the control groups, children in the music groups exhibited greater increases in full-scale IQ. The effect was relatively small, but it generalized across IQ subtests, index scores, and a standardized measure of academic achievement.

Unexpectedly, children in the drama group exhibited substantial pre- to posttest improvements in adaptive social behavior that were not evident in the music groups.

## Methods

There was random assignment of a large sample of children age 6 years old to four different groups Two groups received music lessons: standard keyboard, KodaÂ´ly voice.

Two groups received instruction in a nonmusical artistic activity (drama) or no lessons

The lessons were taught for 36 weeks

Measures of IQ: The WISC-III (The primary outcome measure was the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Third Edition) , the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement and the Parent Rating Scale of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children were administered initially during the summer months before the onset of music or drama lessons and before the children entered first grade at school

## Results

Increases in full-scale IQ occurred in all four groups, and significant increases in IQ, ps \< .005.

The two music groups had increases of similar magnitude despite differences in teaching style ( p \> .8).

The two control groups also had similar increases ( p \> .7), which indicates that drama instruction is not an extracurricular activity associated with notable increases in intellectual development.

Compared with the control groups, the music groups had reliably larger increases in full-scale IQ, t(130)51.99, p \< .05.
