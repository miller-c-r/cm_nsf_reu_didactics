## Bipolar Disorder

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration.

## Three Types of Bipolar

There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. Age of onset is late adolescence to young adulthood.

Bipolar I

Bipolar II

Cyclothymic Disorder

## Examples of Manic versus Depressive Symptoms are listed below:

**MANIC Symptoms**

Racing thoughts

Feeling able to do many things at once without getting tired

Having excessive appetite for food, drinking, sex, or other pleasurable activities

**DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS**

Having trouble concentrating or making decisions

Having a lack of interest in almost all activities

Feeling unable to do even simple things

## Treatments

Pharmacological treatments include lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics.

Non pharmacological treatment example is Psychotherapy.

## Effects of Mood Stabilizers on Brain Energy Metabolism in Mice Submitted to an Animal Model of Mania Induced by Paradoxical Sleep Deprivation, 2015

Study Location: Brazil 

**Broad Question**

Investigating circadian cycles and pathophysiology of affective disorders

Studying an animal model of mania using sleep deprivation

## Specific Questions

Investigating the effects of lithium and valproate in an animal model of mania induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation for 96 hours

Mitochondrial Dysfunction and symptoms of Bipolar Disorder

Investigating locomotor activity and mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes along with effects of Lithium and Valproate

## Materials & Methods


Adult male mice 30-50kg Randomly assigned to three groups with two sleep conditions == **Six Groups.**

Three groups of animals with Saline, Lithium, VPA 

Sleep deprived Vs not sleep deprived in each group.

The animals received injection of Li , VPA  or
saline for 7 days, twice a day. 

On day 3 of treatment, the animals in Li, VPA and saline groups were divided in two groups (15 animals per group): (1) non-deprived; (2)
deprived and subjected to PSD for 96 h. 

On day 7 of treatment the locomotor activity of animals was assessed
1 h after the last injection of Li and VPA.

## Methods cont'd 

Achieving Sleep Deprivation

Animals were placed on 10 circular platforms
(3.5 cm in diameter) with water 1 cm below the upper. As they fall asleep they fall into water and wake up.

## Emotion Dynamics Concurrently and Prospectively Predict Mood Psychopathology

Community or referred sample Hypotheses Methods Findings

Hypothesis 1) Variability and Instability of Negative Affect and Positive Affect but not inertia of NA or PA would be associated with DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorders.2) Instability of NA and PA would predict development of new bipolar spectrum diagnoses. 3)Variability and inertia of NA and PA would be associated concurrently and three years later with major depressive episodes.
