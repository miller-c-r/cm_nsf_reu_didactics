## Bipolar Disorder

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental illness that causes unusual shifts in a person’s mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration.

## Three Types of Bipolar

There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. Age of onset is late adolescence to young adulthood.

Bipolar I

Bipolar II

Cyclothymic Disorder

## Examples of Manic versus Depressive Symptoms are listed below:

**MANIC Symptoms**

Racing thoughts

Feeling able to do many things at once without getting tired

Having excessive appetite for food, drinking, sex, or other pleasurable activities

**DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS**

Having trouble concentrating or making decisions

Having a lack of interest in almost all activities

Feeling unable to do even simple things

## Treatments

Pharmacological treatments include lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics.

Non pharmacological treatment example is Psychotherapy.

## Effects of Mood Stabilizers on Brain Energy Metabolism in Mice Submitted to an Animal Model of Mania Induced by Paradoxical Sleep Deprivation, 2015

Study Location: Brazil

**Broad Question**

Investigating circadian cycles and pathophysiology of affective disorders

Studying an animal model of mania using sleep deprivation

## Specific Questions

-   Investigating the effects of lithium and valproate in an animal model of mania induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation for 96 hours

-   Mitochondrial Dysfunction and symptoms of Bipolar Disorder

-   Investigating locomotor activity and energy metabolism in brain tissue along with effects of Lithium and Valproate

## Background

Postmortem, genetic, brain imaging and peripheral cell studies all support decreased mitochondrial activity in tissue of individuals with Bipolar Disorder

Previous study Correa et al showed that citrate synthase (mitochondrial enzyme) activity was inhibited in rat hippocampus aftermania induced by amphetamine This was reversed by valproate (VPA) and lithium (Li) administration

## Materials & Methods

1.  Adult male mice 30-50kg Randomly assigned to three groups with two sleep conditions == **Six Groups.**

2.  Three groups of animals injected with Saline, Lithium, VPA: Sleep deprived Vs not sleep deprived in each group

3.  The animals received injections for 7 days, twice a day.

4.  **Day 3** animals were divided in two groups (15 animals per group): non sleep deprived vs sleep deprived.

5.  **Day 7** locomotor activity of animals was assessed 1 h after the last injection of Li and VPA.

## Methods cont'd

Achieving Sleep Deprivation

Animals were placed on 10 circular platforms (3.5 cm in diameter) with water 1 cm below the upper. As they fall asleep they fall into water and wake up.

## Locomotor Activity

Randomly assigned for assessment of activity in an open area with grid for 5 minutes.

Measured:

1.  Rearing behavior- the exploratory behavior
2.  Number of times crossed mouse crossed a line

## Results of Sleep Deprivation, Energy Metabolism and Mood Stabilizers

-   PSD mice increased the number of crossings and rearings when compared to the control group

-   Mood stabilizers (Li and VPA) prevented these effects

-   Injections of Li or VPA presented no effect in the increased activity of creatine kinase induced by PSD in hippocampus and cerebral cortex

-   PSD increased citrate synthase only in prefrontal cortex in mice


## Results of Sleep Deprivation, Energy Metabolism and Mood Stabilizers

-   Li and VPA, when administered to **non-deprived-saline groups** did not modify the activity of complexes (mitochondrial energy metabolism)
except in cerebral cortex, where VPA increased complex II activity

-   PSD resulted in a marked reduction of **complex II–III** activity in hippocampus and striatum, and Li and VPA administration prevented this effect

-   PSD resulted in inhibition of **complex IV** activity; the administration of Li prevented PSD-induced reduction of complex IV only in prefrontal cortex

-   VPA administration prevented PSD-induced complex IV
inhibition in prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus,
striatum and cerebral cortex

## Discussion 

-   Results showed that administration of Li and VPA was effective in preventing hyperactivity elicited by PSD.

-   When Li or VPA was administered in non-deprived group, no
differences in locomotor and exploratory activities were
observed, indicating that Li or VPA effects could not be
attributed to sedation

-   The inhibition of complex II–III can also frequently
result in the generation of reactive oxygen species and PSD induced oxidative stress in cortex and hippocampus,

## Emotion Dynamics Concurrently and Prospectively Predict Mood Psychopathology 2020




## Hypotheses

-   Variability and Instability of Negative Affect and Positive Affect but not inertia of NA or PA would be associated with DSM-IV-TR bipolar disorders.
-   Instability of NA and PA would predict development of new bipolar spectrum diagnoses. 
-   Variability and inertia of NA and PA would be associated concurrently and three years later with major depressive episodes.
