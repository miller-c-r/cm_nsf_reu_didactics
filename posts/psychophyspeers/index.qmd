## The Article

Association Between Dynamic Parasympathetic Reactivity to Frustration and Children's Social Success with Peers in Kindergarten

Fry, Cassidy, Gatzke-Koppe, Lisa, M. (2021)

## Background

Topic Psychophysiology

The Polyvagal Perspective

Psychophysiology transforms unobservable psychological or mental processes into measurable physiological data

## The Cardiotachometer

## Background

Appropriate regulatory skills are needed to temper dysregulated responding and redirect frustration in a more positive and prosocial direction

Polyvagal Theory (Porges 2007)

Through polyvagal theory we endeavor to understand the reciprocal influences and bidirectional communication between the heart and the central nervous system

The polyvagal perspective relates autonomic nervous system (ANS) function to behavior. This perspective includes the ANS, neural circuits involved in the regulation of autonomic state, and an interpretation of autonomic reactivity as adaptive

## Key Terms

Anterior Insula

-   activation of anterior insula in goal-blockage and other prefrontal regions associated with processing emotional pain

-   role of anterior insula in autonomic control

Emotional Regulation

This refers to the process of monitoring, evaluating and modulating emotional reactions with the purpose of goal attainment For example upregulating excitement, or dampening frustration to facilitate positive interpersonal interactions

Children who struggle to regulate strong emotional reactivity are more likely to violate social norms

Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia

Respiratory sinys arrhythmia (RSA) is heart rate variability in synchrony with respiration by which the R-R interval on an ECG is shortened during inspiration and prolonged during expiration (Yasuma, F. , Hayano, J 2004)

RSA is utilized as a physiological index of emotoion regulation, or biomarker of dysregulation (Zhang, W., Fagan, S. E., & Gao, Y. (2017) Linked to emotion regulation

RSA Withdrawal

Also referred to as vagal withdrawal. Vagal/RSA withdrawal as opposed to vagal/RSA augmentation. During vagal withdrawal the vagus nerve withdraws its control over the heart resulting in increased PNS(RSA) reactivity Appropriate levels of vagal withdrawal are adaptive and necessary for effectively reacting to external threats.

For example Research has also indicated that greater RSA withdrawal (increased arousal) in response to an emotional challenge reflects greater attentional engagement with the emotional stimulus and a potential loss of regulatory control over affective arousal

Vagus Augmentation

During vagus augmentation the Vagus nerve increases its control over the heart resulting in decreased PNS(RSA) reactivity. Vagal augmentation may lead to increased control of emotionality that can attenuate painful experiences and insensitivity to socializing punishments (Zhang, W., Fagan, S. E., Gao, Y. 2017)

Affective Arousal

Negative Valence System

## Question

Broad Question

Regualting Affective Arousal Peer rejection exacerbating emotion dysregulation

## Specific Question

Relative to socially successful children those rejected by their peers would display atypical reactivity patterns that could consist of greater slope of RSA withdrawal in response to frustration block consistent with anger-oriented response and/or

lack of recovery in the final task block when reward is reinstated consistent with an inability to rebound following frustration

## Methods

Participants

N = 235 Kindergarteners Showing externalizing behavior in low-income urban school

Study across 10 elementary school Children were 54% hign in disruptive behavior Teacher screening tool was utilized for aggressive/oppositional behavior

## Methods

Groups

207 Children in top quartile of disruptive behavior from each classroom

Random assignment to control or intervention group

132 children in the bottom quartile matched for sex and classroom were recruited for comparison group

## Methods

1.  All children received the universal socioemotional curriculum implemented district wide
2.  children assigned to the intervention condition participated in weekly "Friendship Group" training sessions focused on developing and practicing skills related to self-control and peer relations
3.  the game
    1.  Children were informed that the objective of the game was to win as many points as possible to exchange for a prize at the end.
    2.  Participants earned points for correct responses and lost points for incorrect responses, with cumulative points visually represented by a thermometer approximately every 10 trials

<!-- -->

4.  For the first and third blocks (reward), the algorithm strongly favored correct responses, resulting in more positive feedback and a rapid allocation of points

## Results

![](rsa_across_tasks.png){.absolute left="50" right="200" width="800" height="500"}

## Findings

Children who were peer rejected exhibited a significant decline in RSA across the frustration condition

Their RSA levels remained low even when they experienced the reinstatement of reward

In contrast socially accepted children demonstrated more stability in RSA levels across three blocks suggesting greater regulation of affective arousal

## Limitations

Sample size, methods, generalizability to clinical sample, bias during peer assessment

Measures of stress
